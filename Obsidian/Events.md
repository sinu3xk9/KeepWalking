Overview:
Along the path that the player must walk, there will be invisible boxes marked as triggers and each box will pair to some action in the world. These can be things such as texts, calls or physical things in the world moving.

Trash can tip:
The first event will be a a trash can that will tip over when the player gets close. This will be an animation that is triggered on the trashcan for easier modification and iteration.
